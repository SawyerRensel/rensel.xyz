While learning 3D has a lot to do with software, it has a lot more to do with your fundamental mindset.  I've collected some advice along the way that has been transformative in my growth as a creator.</p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#tools-dont-make-the-artist","title":"Tools don't make the artist.","text":"<p>More tools will not make you a better artist.  Good tools might make a good artist faster, but they won't transform you into an \"artist\".  Consider how an illustrator can make stunning artwork with only a paper and pencil.</p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#talent-is-overrated","title":"Talent is overrated.","text":"<p>Remember the tortoise and the hare?  In my experience, art - and for that matter, any skill - is all about showing up daily.  You have to put in the reps consistently.  Over time, the results compound like interest.  A consistent, \"untalented\" artist has a better chance of creating stunning visuals than the weekend warrior-prodigy.</p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#journey-not-destination","title":"Journey, not destination.","text":"<p>Since art is about showing up daily, it's not about creating that one single amazing piece.  Masterpieces will come in due course of producing a regular quantity of artwork.</p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#the-mother-of-invention","title":"The mother of invention.","text":"<p>Necessity is the mother of invention.</p> <p>Without a need, it is unlikely you will stay motivated to show up every day.  Why do you want to create?  What do you need to create?  Start there, and then learn backwards.  </p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#youll-never-be-ready","title":"You'll never be ready.","text":"<p>I've spent years reading manuals, following tutorials, and generally learning about art without actually creating anything.

Tutorials are fun, but are too safe.  They usually don't require any creativity or critical thinking.  </p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#dont-buy-your-own-hype","title":"Don't buy your own hype.","text":"<p>You might learn and build skills quickly, and maybe really succeed as an artist.

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday\" has really helped me exist among the best artists in the world and still feel proud of myself when I learn or achieve something they did years ago.There's always more to learn.  It's a sure sign you're growing if you look back on a piece you made a year ago and feel a bit of revulsion at it and a sudden urge to fix a glaring issue you didn't notice before.</p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/advice/#kill-your-darlings","title":"Kill your darlings.","text":"<p>Feelings of attachment and pride in your work can hinder you from seeing and critiquing it objectively.  Accept feedback if it's given and don't take it personally.  You are not your work.  \"Art is never finished; it's only ever abandoned.\"  Wait a week after \"abandoning\" a piece before publishing it.  Then come back and review it, make any final edits, and publish.</p>","tags":["Draft","Reference"]},{"location":"resources/reference/book_notes/","title":"Book notes","text":"<p>I've spent a lot of time learning about art and creativity.
