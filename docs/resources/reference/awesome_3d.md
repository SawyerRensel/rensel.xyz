# Awesome 3D

As a self-taught 3D artist, people often ask me how they can learn computer graphics on their own.  This page is a living document of resources and advice I have found helpful along my journey.  


## Advice

### Tools don't make the artist.

More tools will not make you a better artist.  Good tools might make a good artist faster, but they won't transform you into an "artist".  

### Talent is overrated.

Remember the tortoise and the hare?  In my experience, art - and for that matter, any skill - is all about showing up daily.  You have to put in the reps *consistently*.  Over time, the results compound like interest.  A consistent, "untalented" artist has a better chance of creating stunning visuals than the weekend warrior-prodigy.

### Journey, not destination.

Since art is about showing up daily, it's not about creating that one single amazing piece.  Masterpieces will come in due course of producing a regular quantity of artwork.

### The mother of invention.

> Necessity is the mother of invention.

Without a *need*, it is unlikely you will stay motivated to show up every day.  Why do you want to create?  What do you *need* to create?  Start there, and then learn backwards.  

### You'll never be ready.

I've spent years reading manuals, following tutorials, and generally learning *about* art without actually *creating* anything.  

### Avoid the tutorial trap.

### Don't buy your own hype.

## Resources

### Book notes

I've spent a lot of time learning *about* art and creativity.  I like to record my notes in a mind map format.  Mind maps are like a tree.  Start from the center (the trunk) and follow the branches outward into more specific, nuanced information.
